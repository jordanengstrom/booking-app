# Notes on Go

## Intro
- A `go.mod` file is kinda like an `__init__.py` file. It initializes a 'module' of some sort.

- All code must belong to a package.

- The first statement in Go must be "package"
  - The standard is: `package main`

## How to run your go program:
Execute this command in the terminal:
```
go run main.go
```

- Constants (`const`) are like variables, except that ther values cannot be changed
